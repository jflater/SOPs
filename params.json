The   bacterial marker gene (16S rRNA gene) extraction kits target the highly conserved 16S marker gene. Because of the   slow rates of evolution of this region of the gene, we can use them to reconstruct a phylogeny of our sample.  \r\n\r\n#PPE\r\n  1. Gloves\r\n  2. Eye protection\r\n  3.

Remove soil samples from -80 freezer, location:<div style=\"width:400px\"><hr/></div>\r\n    note: to preserve samples as best as possible, remove only 1 group at a time. \r\n  02. Layout samples on the bench, from first set, to match the order that the samples are in on the datasheet.\r\n  03. Sterilize goves/hands with 70% ethanol.\r\n  04. Sterilize spatulas by making sure they are clean and then flaming them. \r\n  05. Using sterile spatula and weigh paper, sub sample 0.23 g to 0.25 g of soil into weigh boat.\r\n  06. Record mass of soil on datasheet, confirm that it is the correct sample.\r\n  07. Place fresh funnel in target well and slowly transfer soil from weigh boat into funnel and well.\r\n  08. Repeat two more time for three technical replicates. \r\n  09. Grab or clean your spatula and get a new weigh boat and repeat steps 5-6 for the remaining samples in     the set.\r\n  10. Repeat step 3.\r\n  11. Repeat steps 4-7 for all sets of samples",
